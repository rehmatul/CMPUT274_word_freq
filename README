   Files included:
1) freq.py
2) README

   Notes: 

The file freq.py contains five functions "demo_command_line', "listformation", "dictionaryformation", "outputfile" and "errorhandling()".

*  The demo_command_line function takes the command from the comman line and saves the second argument as the file name which is later used in the other functions. 

*  The listformation function takes filename generated by the first function. It uses the filename to open the file and reads through the file line by line seperating 
the words using split() and saving them in a list. The list formed is returned when this function is called. The function also ensures that the list is stored in lexicological order by using the sorted function.

* The dictionary formation function takes the list formed by our second function and determines the number of times each word is produced saving the count for every word. This function returns the dictionary, frequency on being called.

* The output file function takes in the output of the first 3 functions i.e filename, frequency and my_list to find the density for every value of the key. It then opens an output file and writes on it line by line in the following format:
word count frequency.

* The errorhandling function checks the arguments, gives appropriate error message along with the correct format. If the commandline code is accurate, the function calls all the previous functions within itself and produces the output file in the same directory as freq.py.

*The python file gives an error message if the input file is empty. 

  Assumptions:

* The input file will always be located in the same directory as the python file
* The input file will always be a plan text file
* The output file is either empty or doesnt exist at all. 


  Running Instructions:

* Open a terminal window 
* Use the following format to run the python file
"python3 freq.py <textfilename> where the textfile name is equal to the input file you are using.
* If any of the command line arguments is missing or if there are extra arguments, the code alerts the user by giving an error message on the console. It also provides help to make them aware of the format.
* After running successfully the code produces an output file in the same directory as freq.py
